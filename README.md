# buildroot_mercury5

Buildroot config for MStar/SigmaStar Mercury 5 based machines.


Right now this should work on the midrive d06, midrive d08,
and the generic SSC8336 based dual camera rear view mirror
dashcams aka "mirrorcam".

Note that the camera, audio and display are not supported.
To have a working dashcam we need kernel drivers for the hardware.

Prebuilt sd card images that you can dd to an sd card and
boot in sd boot mode will appear in the releases section.

See [linux-chenxing's mercury5 page](https://github.com/fifteenhex/linux-chenxing/blob/master/mercury5/index.md) for more info.
